<list id="lectureoverview" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>The argument for capitalism and entrepreneurship is not greed, but benefits to consumers. Markets rely on a system called "consumer sovereignty."</item>
  <item>The story of Soichiro Honda, and his struggles with bureaucracy. Innovation requires many people working on different things, and many failures.</item>
  <item>Definitions: Opportunity Cost, Rents, Profits, and Rent-Seeking</item>
  <item>The distinction between profit-seeking and rent-seeking is complicated, but it is socially important. Government has to be careful to restrict rent-seeking opportunities, because private markets can't tell the difference!</item>
  <item>But the incentives of the state are wrong, and the state often fails. Many states actually specialize in rent-extraction. Examples--"mud farmers" and castles along the Rhine River in Germany, are considered.</item>
  <item>The key problem: Rent seeking causes a loss of consumer surplus from exchanges that do not take place. Unseen, hard to measure. Foregone improvements in growth, prosperity and use of goods. There is also the dissipation of resources in war over right to charge tolls, so that spawns competition over rights to control access to "overfishing" the resource. </item>
  <item>A summary: Exchange creates value, New products must pass profit test. But accounting profits are both rents and profits. Problem: rent-seeking destroys value in pursuit of transfers, which are at best neutral. Creating rents is "profitable" for authority that can extract transfers in exchange.</item>
