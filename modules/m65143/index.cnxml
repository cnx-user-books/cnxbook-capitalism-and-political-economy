The public policy implication is that the state should take only minimal actions to regulate voluntary exchange, and those actions should foster such exchanges by reducing transactions costs.</item>
  <item>Greek philosophy and market connections: Xenophon and Aristotle</item>
  <item>Six conditions for an exchange to be "euvoluntary"
(a) Conventional ownership by both parties (b) Conventional capacity to transfer and assign this ownership to the other party (c) The absence of post-exchange regret, for both parties, in the sense that both receive value at least as great as was anticipated at the time of the agreement to exchange (d) The absence of uncompensated externalities (e) Neither party is coerced, in the sense of being forced to exchange by threat (f) Neither party is coerced in the alternative sense of being harmed by failing to exchange.</item>
  <item>Bottom line: Just because an exchange is not coerced by human Agency, it does not follow that it is “voluntary”. And if the exchange is not voluntary, then we have to question the whole set of conclusions about markets being ethical and beneficial. Essentially comes down to many buyers and many sellers. But that’s interesting, because it is exactly the definition of “perfect competition”. So, assumption of perfect competition finesses concerns about ethics of markets. In short, there is a reason why economists and philosophers tend to use different examples!</item></list></para></section><section id="eip-790"><title>Readings</title><para id="eip-732"><list id="readinglist"><item><link url="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.mb.txt" window="new">Aristotle, <emphasis effect="italics"> Nichomachean Ethics </emphasis>, Books III and V</link></item>
